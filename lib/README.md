
# **Dew.js**

Dew is experimental javaScript library for UI programming.  

At the moment, the project is being developed by one person. If you liked the project, please [support][1] it.  

Initially, the project was conceived as a replacement for jquery, as well as a combination of solutions and ideas accumulated over two years. I would also like to note that some solutions that may have analogues were developed by chance :) but have the right to exist.

All detailed **documentation** you can read [there][2].

## Install & Usage

import {Async} from 'dew';
